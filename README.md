//\ Tarp.require - a lightweight JavaScript module loader
=========================================================

Tarp.require is a CommonJS and Node.js compatible module loader licensed as open source under the LGPL v3. It aims to be
as lightweight as possible while not missing any features. It consists of about 150 lines of code (incl. comments) and
its minified version is about 1.7kB right now.

**Important notice:** Tarp.require is still work in progress. This means that even though the code that has been pushed
to GitHub should work in general, some issues might slip through. Also the implementation itself might go though bigger
changes during the development of new features. The plan is to have a stable version by the end of 2017. The tarp-branch
will then become the new master-branch of this repository. Until then I would recommend to use the current
"Smoothie" master-branch, if you need a more stable version.
